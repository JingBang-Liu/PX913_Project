## Description of Problem
This program simulates the motion of an electron an electric field generated by ions. The electric field is discretized over a 2D grid, whilst the electron is a particle that can move freely anywhere within the grid.

## Implementation and usage
The electric field is determined via the Gauss-Seidel method, whereas the motion of the particle in response to that field is found by verlet integration.The implementation of these methods can be found in the `gauss-seidel.f90` and `verlet_integrator.f90` files respectively.
The data is written to a NetCDF file via the module `write_netcdf.f90`, which is then used to visualise the problem using Python's `matplotlib` library in `read_plot_NetCDF.py`. The full program can be compiled and run using makefiles: this is done like so:
```
bash build
```
